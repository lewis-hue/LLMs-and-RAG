A SOC 2 Type I report focuses on the design of an organization’s security controls at a specific point in time, essentially confirming that the systems and processes are in place. However, a Type II report assesses the effectiveness of these controls over a defined period (usually 3 to 12 months). The Type II report provides a more comprehensive evaluation of how well the controls work in practice, offering greater assurance to stakeholders. Because of the time-based evaluation, the Type II report is often seen as more credible and valuable, especially for large clients and partners looking for proof of operational security over an extended period."
